# IM IoT course 
- This is an intensive IoT course for students who want to know basic IoT communication knowledge in hardware and IoT platform. In this course, we aim for three objectives: wired communication (RS485), Low Power Wide Area Communication (LoRa), and IoT platform connectivity.
- #RS485/LoRa/IoT Platform
### #1 Wired network (RS485/Modbus)
The simplest communication network(RS485) and protocol (MODBUS). RS-485 is a serial communication standard primarily used for data acquisition and control systems. Modbus is a serial communication protocol, widely used in industrial automation, that enables devices to exchange data.
- Exercise #1, connecting two Modbus devices with a computer, modify the device ID, observe and recognize the value from the device.

### #2 Wireless network (LPWAN, LoRa)
LoRa (Long Range) is a wireless communication technology known for its ability to transmit small amounts of data over long distances with low power consumption. It's a key technology in low-power wide-area networks (LPWANs) used for the Internet of Things (IoT).  
- Exercise #2, using another communication protocol, LORA, to transmit a value between two devices.

### #3 IoT platform connectivity
Connect a device (powermeter) to a microprocessor (D1 mini, Arduino compatible), and transmit data to the IOT platform for publishing.  
- Exercise #3, learning about how to connect an IoT platform on the internet with your physical device and pass a value by MQTT.

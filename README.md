# IMIoT course
## This is an intensive IoT course for students who want to know basic IoT communication knowledge in hardware and IoT platform. In this course, we aim on three objectives: wired communication (RS485), Low Power Wide Area Communicaiton (LoRa), and IoT platform connectivity. 
### #1 Wired network (RS485/Modbus)
The most simple communication network(RS485) and protocol (MODBUS). RS485 is a serial communication standard primarily used for data acquisition and control systems. Modbus is a serial communication protocol, widely used in industrial automation, that enables devices to exchange data.
-> Exercise #1, connecting two modbus device with computer, modify the device ID, observe and recognize the value from device.

### #2 Wireless network (LPWAN, LoRa)
LoRa (Long Range) is a wireless communication technology known for its ability to transmit small amounts of data over long distances with low power consumption. It's a key technology in low-power wide-area networks (LPWANs) (LPWANs) used for the Internet of Things (IoT)..  
-> Exercise #2, using another communication protocol, LORA, to transmit value between two device.

### #3 IoT platform connectivity
Connect a device (powermeter) to micrco processor (D1 mini, Arduino compatable), and transmit data to the IOT platform for publishing.  
-> Exercise #3, learning about how to connect IOT platform on internet with your physical device and pass value by MQTT.
